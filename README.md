# LDR-MINI-PROJECT

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple LDR circuit on a breadboard. 
When the Green LED light falls on the LDR, it stops current flow to the Yellow LED, turning it off.

## Components
1. Breadboard
2. Resistors
3. Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
4. Transistor BC547
5. DC Voltage Source 6V
6. Yellow LED

## How It Works
When light from the Green LED falls on the LDR, its resistance decreases, 
which prevents current from flowing through the Yellow LED, causing it to turn off.

## Applications
1. Smart Street Lights
2. Laser Security Systems
3. Brightness Control in Devices
4. Garden Lights

## Circuit / Images
