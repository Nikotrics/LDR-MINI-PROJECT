# LDR-MINI-PROJECT
In this project I have made a LDR Circuit on Breadboard

Explaination:
When Light Falls from Green LED on the LDR it will Stop the Current flow of Yellow LED and hence Yellow LED will Stop Glowing.

Components: 
1. Resistors
2. Light Dependant Resistor (LDR)
3. Transistor BC547
4. DC Voltage Source 6V
5. Yellow LED

Applications:
1. Smart Street Lights
2. Laser Security
3. Brightness Control In Devices
4. Garden Lights
